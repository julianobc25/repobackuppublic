# Active Context

This document captures the current active tasks and decisions made during the project. It serves as a living document that reflects the ongoing progress and next steps.

## Current Tasks
- Task 1: Implement backup logic for critical files.
- Task 2: Integrate GitHub operations for repository backups.
- Task 3: Fix and improve token management and network error handling.

## Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Use Python 3.9 as the development environment.
- Decision 2: Adopt a modular approach for the backup logic.
- Decision 3: Implement robust environment variable management using python-dotenv with forced reloading.
- Decision 4: Add network connectivity checks before GitHub API calls to provide better error messages.

## Recent Changes
- Improved environment variable loading system to properly refresh tokens from .env file on program startup
- Added network connectivity check before GitHub API calls with socket-level testing
- Enhanced error handling for network-related issues with user-friendly messages
- Reorganized token saving logic into a proper ConfigSaver class

## Next Steps
- Monitor the effectiveness of the new token refresh system
- Consider adding automatic retry mechanism for network-related failures
- Add network status indicator in the GUI for better user feedback
