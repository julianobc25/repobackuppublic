# System Patterns

This document outlines the system patterns and architectural decisions made during the development of the project. It includes design patterns, architectural styles, and other significant decisions that shape the system's structure and behavior.

## Design Patterns
- Singleton: Used for managing configurations and shared resources.
- Factory: Used for creating instances of classes based on certain conditions.
- Config Manager: Implemented through ConfigSaver class for managing environment variables and token storage.

## Architectural Styles
- Modular Architecture: Components are organized into independent modules.
- Layered Architecture: The system is divided into layers (presentation, business logic, data access).

## Error Handling Patterns
- Network Connectivity Check: Pre-emptive connection testing before API calls
- User-Friendly Error Messages: Translating technical errors into understandable messages
- Layered Error Handling: Specific error handling at each architectural layer

## Environment Management
- Dynamic Environment Loading: Using python-dotenv with forced reloading
- Configuration Persistence: Saving and loading configurations from .env files
- Token Refresh Pattern: Ensuring environment variables are always up-to-date

## Key Decisions
- Decision 1: Adoption of a modular architecture to enhance maintainability.
- Decision 2: Use of layered architecture to separate concerns.
- Decision 3: Implementation of pre-emptive network checks before API calls.
- Decision 4: Use of python-dotenv for configuration management with forced reloading.
- Decision 5: Structured error handling with user-friendly messages.

## Best Practices
- Always verify network connectivity before making API calls
- Use socket-level testing for basic connectivity checks
- Provide clear, user-friendly error messages
- Implement proper environment variable management
- Ensure configuration changes are persisted correctly
- Use proper exception handling with specific error types
